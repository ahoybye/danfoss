<div class="heading-black-smaller">Create oxygen O<sub>2</sub> and absorb carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub></div>
Plants and trees create more oxygen than they consume for growth. Green plants absorb also harmful gasses as Sulphur dioxide SO<sub>2</sub>, Nitrogen dioxide NO<sub>2</sub>, Carbon monoxide CO.<br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Decrease air temperature</div>
One hectare of forest evaporates up to 350 liters (92 gallons) of water per hour and decrease air temperature about 6 - 9˚C. (43 - 48˚F)<br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Soil Repair</div>
Tree roots fix soil in slopes and banks and protect it against erosion. <br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Decrease noise</div>
A strip of trees 10 meters (32 feet) wide decrease noise up to 6 dB. Leafed trees absorb 26% sound (acoustic energy) and 74% return and disperse (often use as noise barrier). <br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Dust and micro-organism absorption</div>
Leafs act as filters for dust. Trees are able to catch 27% of dust in towns. Trees creates substances to kill pathogenic germs as antibiotics. There is up to 200-times less bacteria in coniferous forest than in street in town.<br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Hold moisture and clean water</div>
Forests work as sponges during rain and help reduce flooding.<br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Increase biodiversity</div>
Trees create shelters and homes for several kinds of plants and animals. <br/>
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Industrial value</div>
Fruit, Wood for decoration, paper production, fire, .... Leafs, bark and flowers for medicines. <br/> 
<br/><div class="heading-black-smaller">Social value</div>
Forests, parks are used for relaxation and meetings of families, friends, people.

<div class="heading-green">The Carbon Cycle</div>
All living things are made of carbon. Carbon is also a part of the ocean, air, and even rocks. Because the Earth is a dynamic place, carbon does not stay still. It is on the move! 
<br/>
 <br/> 
<table width="100%">
    <tr><td>

    </td>         
    <td valign="top">
    In the atmosphere, carbon is attached to some oxygen in a gas called carbon dioxide.   Plants use carbon dioxide and sunlight to make their own food for growth. The carbon becomes part of the plant. Plants that die and are buried may turn into fossil fuels made of carbon like coal and oil over millions of years. When humans burn fossil fuels, most of the carbon quickly enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. 
    <br/><br/>
    Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and traps heat in the atmosphere. Without it and other greenhouse gases, Earth would be a frozen world. But humans have burned so much fuel that there is about 30% more carbon dioxide in the air today than there was about 150 years ago, and Earth is becoming a warmer place. In fact, ice cores show us that there is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there has been in the last 420,000 years.
