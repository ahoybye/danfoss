The subject customer contract is out for customer signature and subsequent return to Danfoss. Please follow up with the customer to receive 1 signed original (either paper or digital depending on the arrangements made with the customer).
 </br> </br>
Upon receipt of the signed original  
  </br> 
1) Forward the signed paper original to the regional Librarian who will scan and upload a digital copy into the Contract Record and file the original. 
  </br> </br>
2) if using digital documents only, upload the file with complete signatures to the Signed Documents section of the Contract Record. Then, send a Task to the Librarian to inform them that the file has been uploaded. (This is the only way they will know they will not receive an original paper document.)
