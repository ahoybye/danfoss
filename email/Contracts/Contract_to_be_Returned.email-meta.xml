    <subject>{!Contract__c.Name} for {!Contract__c.Customer__c} is pending customer signature</subject>
    <textOnly>The subject customer contract is out for customer signature and subsequent return to Danfoss. Please follow up with the customer to receive 1 signed original (either paper or digital depending on the arrangements made with the customer).   Upon receipt of the signed original  1) Forward the signed paper original to the regional Librarian who will scan and upload a digital copy into the Contract Record and file the original.   2) if using digital documents only, upload the file with complete signatures to the Signed Documents section of the Contract Record. Then, send a Task to the Librarian to inform them that the file has been uploaded. (This is the only way they will know they will not receive an original paper document.)   3) be sure to mark this task complete in order to advance the workflow process.</textOnly>
